                    The Instant Pot is one of my favorite tools. 
                    I use this to cook a variety of foods: chicken, 
                    soups, potatoes, refried beans, cheesecake, yogurt,
                     rice, and more. I love how easy it is to use as well 
                     as the superb way that it cooks the food. After several 
                     months of owning one, I purchased a second one. This allows 
                     me to cook main and side dishes at the same time. Having 
                     a second Instant Pot is also convenient on days that I 
                     make yogurt because that is a full day’s process.

                    My Bosch mixer is a staple in my kitchen. It makes the best bread! 
                    It also whips up large batches of dough or batter. I use this for 
                    making all of my yeast breads. When making white, yeast breads, 
                    the first rise time can be eliminated in recipes due to the perfect
                     kneading power of this machine. This speeds up the process of 
                     making yeast bread. Saving an hour on rise time when craving 
                     a warm cinnamon roll is a win!

                    This chopper has been a time-saving tool in my kitchen. 
                    It also adds more consistency to my cuts to create better 
                    dishes. Not only are the even cuts more pleasing to the
                     eye, but they also cook more evenly as well. This tool 
                     also makes meal prepping a breeze.  I often cut peppers
                      and onions from my garden with this tool to freeze for 
                      later use. It also helps me whip up a batch of fresh
                       salsa in no time! This tool also makes it easy for 
                       kids to get involved in the kitchen, chopping and 
                       dicing.
